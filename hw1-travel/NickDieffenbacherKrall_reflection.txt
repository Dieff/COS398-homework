Homework 1 Reflection

Going in to COS398, I already had some experience with web development.
In particular, I spent last summer working on an internal corporate web application
during my internship at Garmin. My summer project was very successful
(I got a return offer!), and had given me a decent background in HTML and Javascript.
However, this class is probably the first time I have ever sat down and designed a vanilla
website with HTML and CSS from scratch.

In previous projects, I have always used some sort of high level Javascript or CSS framework,
such as ReactJS or Bootstrap. Packages included with these frameworks usually
solved the basic CSS layout issues for me. For this assignment, I had
to make the layouts, columns, and grids on my own. I had quite a hard time with certain elements,
such as the title page, until I began adopting CSS Flexbox. I find Flexbox much more intuitive
than using `float`, and I hope to keep using it for my other projects. I also want to check
out CSS grid.

The hardest single part of the website was the "Landmarks" page. In particular, creating the grid
of landmark cards was a challenge because of the multiple, nested, horizontal layouts.
The interaction of <img> tags with CSS flexbox is also confusing, and ultimately I resorted
to setting absolute sized for my images. I don't think this page would look very good on mobile.
Creating the card layout gave me many ideas for how to approach future projects in a simpler way.
