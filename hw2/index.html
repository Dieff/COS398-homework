          <h1>The Railroads of Chongqing</h1>
          <p>
            Chongqing has the fourth largest city in China, with a population of
            16 million people. It is one of the top 50 cities in the world based
            on airport traffic, scholarly output, and GDP. The city has a bright
            future, considerd by China to be a "gateway to the West", and a key
            location in the Belt and Road Initiative. But, until 2005, the
            Chongqing had virtually no mass transpotation of any kind.

          Chongqing is a city of steep hills and narrow river valleys. In each
          direction, the city is borderd by a major major mountain range (Daba,
          Wu, Wuling, and Dalou). This is the area of the famous Three Gorges,
          where the Yangtze River has cut through entire mountains through
          thousands of years of geography. The area also features dense
          sub-tropical forests and natural limestone caves. Although Chongqing
          has developed significantly in the 1990s, the challenging gepgrahy had
          prevented the construction of any metro system or railway, such as
          those that exist in most other Chinese cities.

        <h2>Chongqing Rail Transit System</h2>
        <p>
          In 2005, the Chongqing Rail Transit (CRT) system opened. This was the
          6th documented attempt to create a metro, tram, or rail system for the
          city. The transportation network was uniquely designed to meet the
          challenges of the terrain. Two of the ten lines are monorails, a type
          of train which is better able to handle slopes and tight curves. The
          monorail portion of the system was the largest monorail in the world
          at the time of opening.
